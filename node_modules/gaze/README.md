## Usage
Install the module with: `npm install gaze` or place into your `package.json`
and run `npm install`.

```javascript
var gaze = require('gaze');

// Watch all .js files/dirs in process.cwd()
gaze('**/*.js', function(err, watcher) {
  // Files have all started watching
  // watcher === this

  // Get all watched files
<<<<<<< HEAD
  var watched = this.watched();
=======
  console.log(this.watched());
>>>>>>> 4753cbf1d284adcdd453d50fb505365ab9615af2

  // On file changed
  this.on('changed', function(filepath) {
    console.log(filepath + ' was changed');
  });

  // On file added
  this.on('added', function(filepath) {
    console.log(filepath + ' was added');
  });

  // On file deleted
  this.on('deleted', function(filepath) {
    console.log(filepath + ' was deleted');
  });

  // On changed/added/deleted
  this.on('all', function(event, filepath) {
    console.log(filepath + ' was ' + event);
  });

  // Get watched files with relative paths
<<<<<<< HEAD
  var files = this.relative();
=======
  console.log(this.relative());
>>>>>>> 4753cbf1d284adcdd453d50fb505365ab9615af2
});

// Also accepts an array of patterns
gaze(['stylesheets/*.css', 'images/**/*.png'], function() {
  // Add more patterns later to be watched
  this.add(['js/*.js']);
});
```

### Alternate Interface

```javascript
var Gaze = require('gaze').Gaze;

var gaze = new Gaze('**/*');

// Files have all started watching
gaze.on('ready', function(watcher) { });

// A file has been added/changed/deleted has occurred
gaze.on('all', function(event, filepath) { });
```

### Errors

```javascript
<<<<<<< HEAD
gaze('**/*', function(error, watcher) {
  if (error) {
    // Handle error if it occurred while starting up
  }
});

// Or with the alternative interface
var gaze = new Gaze();
gaze.on('error', function(error) {
  // Handle error here
});
gaze.add('**/*');
=======
gaze('**/*', function() {
  this.on('error', function(err) {
    // Handle error here
  });
});

#### Properties

* `options` The options object passed in.

## FAQs

### Why Another `fs.watch` Wrapper?
I liked parts of other `fs.watch` wrappers but none had all the features I
needed. This lib combines the features I needed from other fine watch libs:
Speedy data behavior from
[paulmillr's chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar), API interface
from [mikeal's watch](https://github.com/mikeal/watch) and file globbing using
[isaacs's glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) which is also used by
[cowboy's Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt).

### How do I fix the error `EMFILE: Too many opened files.`?
This is because of your system's max opened file limit. For OSX the default is
very low (256). Increase your limit temporarily with `ulimit -n 10480`, the
number being the new max limit.
